    <h3>About</h3>
      <p>The Resistance: Avalon is a very intense social deduction game for 5-10 players.  While it shares similiarities with games like Werewolf, Mafia and even Battlestar Galactica it has many very unique features such as a quick 30 minute play time, no moderator required and no player elimination.</p>
      <p>Bring your poker face and be prepared to betray the trust of your fellow human beings.</p>
