    <h1>Rulebook</h1>
    <h2>This is how you play (ignore everything else Matt tells you)</h2>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>To begin, everyone will be given a role. Once you have this role, the game has officially started. Trust no one but yourself (unless you are good and are thinking of strategically voting fail. This never works. Don't do it. Crush that thought. Yes, someone has tried it. If you still think this is a valid strategy, please go here.) The number of good and evil players in the game will be determined by the table shown below.</p>

        <h4>Number of "Good" and "Evil" Players</h4>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>Number of Players</td>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>6</td>

              <td>8</td>
              <td>9</td>
              <td>10</td>

        <p>Besides telling you whether you are good or evil, some cards have special roles on them. The table below shows you the possible special roles and their abilities, respectively.</p>
