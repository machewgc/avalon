    <h1>Rulebook</h1>
    <h2>This is how you play (ignore everything else Matt tells you)</h2>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>The Resistance: Avalon is a game of hidden loyalty. Players are either Loyal Servants of Arthur fighting for Goodness and honor or aligned with the Evil ways of Mordred. Good wins the game by successfully completing three Quests. Evil wins if three Quests end in failure. Evil can also win by assassinating Merlin at game's end or if a Quest cannot be undertaken.</p>
      <p>Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discussion, deception, accusation, and logical deduction are all equally important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day.</p>
    <h3>The Cards and Tokens</h3>
      <p><strong><em>Character Cards</em></strong> - Determine the player's loyalty <em>(each player is either Good or Evil)</em>. Character cards on the side of Good have Arthur's sigil on blue background and Evil have Mordred's sigil on red background. Hereafter references to a player's <em>Good</em> or <em>Evil</em> loyalty are denoted with a special font. Some Characters have special powers during the game - Merlin and the Assassinare included in all games and the remaining special character cards are optional. <strong>A player's Character Card may not be revealed at any point in the game, nor the character art discussed.</strong></p>
      <p><strong><em>Leader Token</em></strong> - Designates the player that will propose the Quest Team.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Team Tokens</em></strong> - Allocate positions on the Quest Team.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Vote Tokens</em></strong> - Approve or reject the Leader's proposed Quest Team.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Quest Cards</strong></em> - Determine a Quest's success or failure.</p>
    <h3>Set Up</h3>
      <p>Upon selecting the number of players and optional rules and characters, a leader will be randomly selected in the group; the Leader receives the Leader token. Use the chart below to determine the number of <em>Good</em> and <em>Evil</em> players.</p>

        <h4>Number of "Good" and "Evil" Players</h4>
          <table style="width:25%">
            <tr>
              <td>Number of Players</td>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>6</td>
              <td>7</td>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>9</td>
              <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Number of Good</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>6</td>
              <td>6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Number of Bad</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>4</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        <p>Each player will be randomly assigned one of the <em>Good (either a Loyal Servant of Arthur, Merlin, or an optional special Good character)</em> or <em>Evil (either a Minion of Mordred, the assassin, or an optional special Evil character)</em> roles from the table above.</p>
      <h3>Evil reveals itself, and Merlin looks into the future</h3>
        <p><em>True evil is rampant in the land. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of Evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered all will be lost.</em></p>
        <p>After all the players know their loyalty, the <em>Evil</em> players will learn each other's loyalty, and Merlin will learn all the <em>Evil</em> players. All optional special characters will also gain knowledge, according to their role description.</p>
        <p>As a reference, all characters, their alignments, and their abilities are listed in the Table below.</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td class="role-column">Role</td>
              <td>Alignment</td>
              <td>Ability</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="role-column">Merlin</td>
              <td>Good</td>
              <td>Knows who has the evil thumbs.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="role-column">Perceval</td>
              <td>Good</td>
              <td>Knows who Merlin is.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="role-column">Assassin</td>
              <td>Evil</td>
              <td>Can assassinate Merlin. This ends the game and results in a victory for evil.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
    <h3>Game Play</h3>
      <p>The game consists of several Rounds; each Round has a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. In the Team Buildin phase, the Leader proposes a Team to complete a Quest - all the players vote to either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team, passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. In the Quest phase, those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the Quest is successful.</p>
      <p>Choose your Team wisely. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single <em>Evil</em> player on the team is enough for failure.</p>
    <h3>Team Building Phase</h3>
      <p><em>It is a time for great decisions and strong leaders. Not all knights and ladies of Avalon are loyal to Arthur, and yet you must choose only those that are Good to represent him in his quests. If an open ear and eye is kept, Merliin's sage advice can be discerned as whispers of truth.</em></p>
      <p><strong><em>Team Assignment:</strong></em> After appropriate discussion, the Leader chooses the appropriate number of Players to receive Team Tokens <em>(using the following chart, or numbers on the tableau)</em>.</p>
