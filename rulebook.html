      <h2>This is how you play (ignore everything else Matt tells you)</h2>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The Resistance: Avalon is a game of hidden loyalty. Players are either Loyal Servants of Arthur fighting for Goodness and honor or aligned with the Evil ways of Mordred. Good wins the game by successfully completing three Quests. Evil wins if three Quests end in failure. Evil can also win by assassinating Merlin at game's end or if a Quest cannot be undertaken.</p>
        <p>Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discussion, deception, accusation, and logical deduction are all equally important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day.</p>
      <h3>The Cards and Tokens</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Character Cards</em></strong> - Determine the player's loyalty <em>(each player is either Good or Evil)</em>. Character cards on the side of Good have Arthur's sigil on blue background and Evil have Mordred's sigil on red background. Hereafter references to a player's <em>Good</em> or <em>Evil</em> loyalty are denoted with a special font. Some Characters have special powers during the game - Merlin and the Assassinare included in all games and the remaining special character cards are optional. <strong>A player's Character Card may not be revealed at any point in the game, nor the character art discussed.</strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>Leader Token</em></strong> - Designates the player that will propose the Quest Team.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Team Tokens</em></strong> - Allocate positions on the Quest Team.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Vote Tokens</em></strong> - Approve or reject the Leader's proposed Quest Team.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Quest Cards</strong></em> - Determine a Quest's success or failure.</p>
      <h3>Set Up</h3>
        <p>Upon selecting the number of players and optional rules and characters, a leader will be randomly selected in the group; the Leader receives the Leader token. Use the chart below to determine the number of <em>Good</em> and <em>Evil</em> players.</p>

          <h4>Number of "Good" and "Evil" Players</h4>
            <table style="width:25%">
              <tr>
                <td>Number of Players</td>
                <td>5</td>

              </tr>
            </table>
          <p>Each player will be randomly assigned one of the <em>Good (either a Loyal Servant of Arthur, Merlin, or an optional special Good character)</em> or <em>Evil (either a Minion of Mordred, the assassin, or an optional special Evil character)</em> roles from the table above.</p>
        <h3>Evil reveals itself, and Merlin looks into the future</h3>
          <p><em>True evil is rampant in the land. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of Evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered all will be lost.</em></p>
          <p>After all the players know their loyalty, the <em>Evil</em> players will learn each other's loyalty, and Merlin will learn all the <em>Evil</em> players. All optional special characters will also gain knowledge, according to their role description.</p>
          <p>As a reference, all characters, their alignments, and their abilities are listed in the Table below.</p>

      <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>The game consists of several Rounds; each Round has a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. In the Team Buildin phase, the Leader proposes a Team to complete a Quest - all the players vote to either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team, passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. In the Quest phase, those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the Quest is successful.</p>
        <p>Choose your Team wisely. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single <em>Evil</em> player on the team is enough for failure.</p>
      <h3>Team Building Phase</h3>
        <p><em>It is a time for great decisions and strong leaders. Not all knights and ladies of Avalon are loyal to Arthur, and yet you must choose only those that are Good to represent him in his quests. If an open ear and eye is kept, Merliin's sage advice can be discerned as whispers of truth.</em></p>
        <p><strong><em>Team Assignment:</strong></em> After appropriate discussion, the Leader chooses the appropriate number of Players to receive Team Tokens <em>(using the following chart, or numbers on the tableau)</em>.</p>
        <table style="width:25%">
          <tr>
            <td>Players</td>
            <td>5</td>

            <td>5</td>
            <td>5</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      <p>The Leader can be on the Team but is not required to be so.A player may only be assigned on Team Token.</p>
      <p><em>Discuss, Discuss, Discuss.All the players should participate in helping the Leader make the right choice of players to be on the Team. Active and logical discussion is a great way to catch Mordred's agents in their webs of deceit.</em></p>
      <p><strong><em>Team Vote:</strong></em> After appropriate discussion, the Leader calls for a vote on Team assignments.</p>
      <p><em>The Leader is proposing the Team - but all the players have a Vote in whether they accept or reject the proposal. The Leader can be Evil, or on e of the players chosen could be a mistake. Don't feel that you need to accept all the proposed Teams. If you reject the team then a new Leader can propose a different Team, maybe one without any Evil players on it.</em></p>
      <p>Each player including the Leader secretly selects one Vote card. Once everyone has selected their Vote card, everyone's vote will be revealed. The team is approved if the majority accepts. If the Team is approved, play continues in the Quest phase <em>(below)</em>. If the Team is rejected <em>(a tied Vote is also rejection)</em>, the Leader passes clockwise and the Team building phase is repeated.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Evil wins the game if five Teams are rejected in a single round (5 consecutive failed Votes).</strong></em></p>
      <h3>Strategy Tip: Trust No One</h3>
      <p>If you aren't confident of every one on the proposed Team, then you should strongly consider rejecting the proposal. Rejecting a Team is not a sign that you are Evil. A group of skilled players will usually do the Vote phase three or more times before agreeing to a Team. Watch who approves, and aske them why they approved. Sometimes Evil players will approve because they know another Evil player was included. Merlin can also use his voting as a signal, but be careful as the Evil players will be watching.</p>
    <h3>Quest Phase</h3>
      <p><em>You have debated well and wisely chosen the brave knights and ladies with whom you place your trust. Now, it is time to measure a person's true intent and loyalty to the noble cause for which Arthur fights. Be true and goodness will prevail.</em></p>
      <p>Each Team member will choose a Success or Fail Quest card from their hands. The Quest cards will be shuffled before revealing. The Quest is completed successfully only if all the cards revealed are Success cards. The Quest fails if one <em>(or more)</em> Fail cards have been played.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Note:</strong> The Good players must select the Quest Success card; Evil may select either the Quest Success or Quest Fail card.</em></p>
      <p><strong><em>Note:</strong> The 4th Quest (and only the 4th Quest) in games of 7 or more players requires at least two Quest Fail cards to be a failed Quest.</em></p>
      <p>A successful Quest will be indicated on the tableau with a blue Score marker containing Arthur's sigil. A failed Quest will be indicated with a red Score marker with Mordred's sigil. After the Quest has been completed <em>(either in success or failure)</em>, the Round marker will advance to the next Quest space on the tableau. The Leader then becomes the next clockwise player and the next Round begins in Team building phase.</p>
    <h3>Game End:</h3>
      <p><em>Arthur and Goodness prevail if the team of Good is able to successfully complete three Quests without revealing Merlin's true identity. Mordred's dark forces of Evil triumph when the three quests end in failure, or are devious enough to force Merlin into the open.</p>
      <p>The game ends immediately after either three successful or three failed Quests. The Evil players win if three Quests fail. The game also ends immediately and the Evil players win if faive Teams are rejected in a single round <em>(5 consecutive failed Votes)</em>.</p>
